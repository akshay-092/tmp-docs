## Overview

The Blocked Messages endpoint in the Moderation Service API provides app owners and collaborators with the capability to retrieve details about messages that have been blocked due to violations of message moderation rules. This endpoint plays a crucial role in enabling platform app owners and collaborators to review and manage content that has been deemed inappropriate, harmful, or non-compliant with platform guidelines.

### List Blocked Messages
