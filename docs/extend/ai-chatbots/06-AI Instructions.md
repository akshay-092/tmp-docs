Configure the instruction by giving it a name and an appropriate prompt.

This prompt enables you to add a unique instruction to a CometChat Bot. Providing a brief description of its character, tone, or style will be helpful. You can refer to our Default Instructions to understand how you can create a custom instruction that suits your use case.

Newly added instructions can be edited as well as deleted.

Instructions are soft-deleted to avoid issues when a instruction is attached to a particular bot.
