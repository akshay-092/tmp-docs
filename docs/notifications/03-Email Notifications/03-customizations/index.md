Customizations allow controlling notifications for message events, group events, and call events. Users can set preferences for incoming notifications based on notification schedules, Do Not Disturb (DND) mode, and the mute status of specific conversations.

Additional customizations include modifications to notification templates and sounds. These options also ensure that user privacy is maintained while displaying notifications on the device.

For more information, refer to [Preferences, Templates & Sounds](./preferences-templates-sounds) documentation.
