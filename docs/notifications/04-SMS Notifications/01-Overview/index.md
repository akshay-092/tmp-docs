## Introduction

SMS notifications are useful as a re-engagement tool, prompting users to return to the app after an extended absence. These are useful for providing updates on messages that are unread while the user was away. The SMS alerts or notifications are dispatched at predetermined intervals and not in real time.

## Key features

1. **Notify users at intervals**:

    Users who have unread messages can be notified at the specified intervals. The SMS includes a message prompting users to return to the app and are triggered for every such conversation.

1. **Contacts management**

    Once the Phone numbers are verified and vetted on your end, they can be shared with the notifications system using APIs.

1. **Preferences management**:

    Through CometChat's Notification Preferences, users and admins have the ability to customize the notification settings, that help provide pertinent alerts while avoiding notification fatigue.

1. **Ability to set up a schedule**:

    CometChat's notifications service ensures that the notifications are delivered based on the specified daily timetable, adhering to the user's local time zone.

1. **Ability to mute notifications**:

    Users have the option to completely mute notifications for the app (DND mode), or selectively mute them for specific users and groups, for a designated duration.

1. **Ability to set up Templates**:

    CometChat offers developers a set of pre-defined templates that define the content shown in SMS.
