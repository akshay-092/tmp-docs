## Conversation Starters

When a user initiates a new chat, the UI kit displays a list of suggested opening lines that users can select, making it easier for them to start a conversation. These suggestions are powered by CometChat's AI, which predicts contextually relevant conversation starters.

For a comprehensive understanding and guide on implementing and using the Conversation Starters, refer to our specific guide on the [Conversation Starter](/ai/conversation-starter).

Once you have successfully activated the [Conversation Starter](/ai/conversation-starter) from your CometChat Dashboard, the feature will automatically be incorporated into the [MessageList](../../05-Components/07-message-list.md) Component of UI Kits.

## Smart Replies

Smart Replies are AI-generated responses to messages. They can predict what a user might want to say next by analyzing the context of the conversation. This allows for quicker and more convenient responses, especially on mobile devices.

For a comprehensive understanding and guide on implementing and using the Smart Replies, refer to our specific guide on the [Smart Replies](/ai/smart-replies).

Once you have successfully activated the [Smart Replies](/ai/smart-replies) from your CometChat Dashboard, the feature will automatically be incorporated into the Action sheet of [MessageComposer](../../05-Components/08-message-composer.md) Component of UI Kits.
